# The README.md file contains illustrative CRs which we ignore in code review.
# At one point, we had prefixed them with a '$' character ($CR) so that they
# would not be grepped as actual CRs. However doing this adds a level of
# complexity for new readers and people discovering the project. Ignoring CRs
# from the README prevents us from using the CRs workflow in this file. We've
# accepted this tradeof.
