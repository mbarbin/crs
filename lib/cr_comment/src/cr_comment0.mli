(** Code review comments embedded in source code.

    This module provides the core types and functions for representing and
    manipulating code review comments (CRs) embedded directly in source code
    using a special syntax. A CR captures actionable feedback, metadata, and
    assignment information, supporting workflows for tracking, resolving, and
    managing code review discussions within the codebase. *)

  type t [@@deriving compare, equal, sexp_of]

  val to_string : t -> string
  val create : string -> t
end

module Header : sig
  type t [@@deriving equal, sexp_of]

  (** [reporter] is [user] in [CR user...]. *)
  val reporter : t -> Vcs.User_handle.t

  (** [recipient] is [user2] in [CR user1 for user2: ...]. Assigning CRs to
      particular users is optional. This returns [None] if that part is left
      out, such as in [CR user1: Comment]. *)
  val recipient : t -> Vcs.User_handle.t option

  val status : t -> Status.t

  (** This returns the qualifier if present ([Soon] for [CR-soon] or [Someday]
      for [CR-someday]). If there is no qualifier specified, this returns
      [None]. *)
  val qualifier : t -> Qualifier.t

  (** [priority t] represents the expectation as to when work on the CR is meant
      to happen. It is based on the header's qualifier except that XCRs are
      meant to be worked on [Now]. *)
  val priority : t -> Priority.t

  module With_loc : sig
    (** These getters allows you to access the position of each elements of the
        CR header. This is meant for tools processing CRs automatically, such
        as CRs rewriters. *)

    (** The location includes the entire reporter username, without the
        surrounding spaces. *)
    val reporter : t -> Vcs.User_handle.t Loc.Txt.t

    (** The location includes the entire recipient username, if it is present,
        without the surrounding spaces. In particular, the location does not
        include the ["for"] keyword itself. *)
    val recipient : t -> Vcs.User_handle.t Loc.Txt.t option

    (** The location includes the entire keyword ["CR"] or ["XCR"] depending on
        the case. It stops right before the following char, that being a space
        or a ['-'] (and thus does not include it). *)
    val status : t -> Status.t Loc.Txt.t

    (** When the CR is qualified as [Soon] or [Someday], the location returned
        starts right after the dash separator (but does not include it), and
        contains the entire qualifier keyword. For example, the location will
        include ["soon"] for a [CR-soon]. When the CR has no qualifier, there
        is no keyword to attach a location to : conventionally, we return
        instead the location of the CR [status] in this case. *)

(** [content] is the text of the CR with comment markers removed from the
    beginning and end (if applicable). See also {!reindented_content}. *)

    the comments boundaries from [path] as well. *)

(** [priority t] represents the expectation as to when work on the CR is meant
    to happen. It is based on the header's qualifier except that XCRs and
    invalid CRs are meant to be worked on [Now]. *)
val priority : t -> Priority.t

(** This digest is computed such that changes in positions in a file, or changes
    in whitespaces are ignored. It is used by downstream systems to detect
    that two CRs are equivalent, which in turn may affect when a CR is
    active. *)
val digest_ignoring_minor_text_changes : t -> Digest_hex.t

(** {1 Print} *)

(** Show the CR with a line showing the file position. *)
val to_string : t -> string

(** [reindented_content t] returns the content of the CR with leading
    indentation removed or normalized. This is useful for displaying multiple
    CRs together in a unified format, such as in [crs grep]. [new_line_prefix]
    allows to control the indentation or margin used to produce the new output.
    It defaults to [""]. Trailing whitespace are removed from [new_line_prefix]
    as needed. *)
val reindented_content : ?new_line_prefix:string -> t -> string

(** Sorts the supplied list of CRs and outputs it to the supplied out channel,
    separated by newline characters. *)

(** {1 Private}

    This module is exported to be used by libraries with strong ties to
    [cr_comment]. Its signature may change in breaking ways at any time without
    prior notice, and outside the guidelines set by semver.

    In particular, the intention here is that CRs may only be created using
    dedicated helpers libraries that are defined in this project, parsing them
    from files in vcs trees. *)
