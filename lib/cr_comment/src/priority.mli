(** The [Priority.t] type represents a priority classification that can be
    associated with a code review comment (CR). Assignment of a priority is
    not always direct; rather, it is typically computed as a function of other
    elements such as the CR's kind, review context, and qualifier.

    This classification is intended as a general convenience to help organize
    and filter CRs by indicating the reviewers's intent or suggested importance,
    but it does not prescribe a specific workflow or deadline.

    The meaning and enforcement of each priority class — such as when a [Soon]
    or [Someday] comment should be addressed — are intentionally left undefined
    at this level. Higher-level tools or code review systems built on top of CRs
    may define their own policies or behaviors around these categories.

    Typical interpretations:
    - [Now]: Should be addressed promptly (while working on a PR for example).
    - [Soon]: Should be addressed in the near future.
    - [Someday]: Can be deferred until later.

    These categories are intentionally flexible and meant to support a variety of
    development processes and team conventions. *)
