(** In the tests we want to avoid test CRs to be mistaken for actual CRs, thus
    we perform some dynamic string substitutions. Test CRs are prefixed by the
    '$' symbol. For example:

    {[
      (* $CR user1 for user2: This is a test CR. *)
    ]}

    [parse_file ~path ~file_contents] first removes the '$' prefixes, and then
    parse the contents using the regular code path to extract CRs from file.

    The provided [path] is not accessed on disk, we simply use it to build
    locations for the resulting CRs. The contents is solely read from
    [file_contents]. *)

(** A shared list of common cases for CRs. This is used by several tests as a
    basis for making sure to handle various kinds of CRs. *)
