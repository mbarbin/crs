# Notice

To support reviewdog diagnostic we are making use of rdjson format defined by
the prototype `reviewdog.proto`, which is part of the reviewdog distribution and
published under MIT.

We compile it to OCaml with `ocaml-protoc`.

## LICENSE-reviewdog-rdf-MIT.txt

We haven't added any code to the code generated by ocaml-protoc, but in case
there's any doubts, the resulting library here is released under MIT as well.
